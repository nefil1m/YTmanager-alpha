yt-manager
==========

It's a simple YouTube playlist manager which I've created just to play a bit with YT API. There's almost nothing in here at the moment but I've just started working on this.

For now I have just very basic functionality, you can only play videos from your playlists. Code sucks but it's better than last commit.

Here's a live demo:
